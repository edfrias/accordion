# accordion
Another ES6 framework-less accordion repo to try things.
Based on my: https://codepen.io/edofris/pen/JLwQMz

This are the criteria for this component:
 - Only js vanilla without frameworks
 - Use ES6
 - Try to add new sections with Ajax calls

 Hope this could help someone, is reeeally improvable...

---

- Download the repo
- Install dependencies with `npm install` command
- You can build the project with `npm run build`
- To try it just run the project with `npm run start`
- You can pass the eslint or stylelint with `npm run lint` all together or `npm run lint-(css/js)` separatedly
